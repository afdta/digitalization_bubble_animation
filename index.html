		<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n recent decades, the diffusion of digital technology into nearly every business and workplace, also known as “digitalization,” has been remaking the U.S. economy and the world of work, increasing the potential of individuals, firms and society while also contributing to a series of troublesome impacts and inequalities, such as worker pay disparities across many demographics, and the divergence of metropolitan economic outcomes. </p>

		<p>This report presents a detailed analysis of changes in the digital content of 545 occupations covering 90 percent of the U.S. workforce in all industries since 2001. The analysis categorizes U.S. occupations into jobs that require high, medium or low digital skills. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/metro_test-file2.pdf#page=20" target="_blank" class="blue-link">For more on methodolgy, see page X of the report <span class="link-icon"></span> »</a> </p>

		<p>The full report concludes with implications of the key findings and suggests ways communities can work with firms and workers to spread the benefits of digitalization while mitigating its potentially harmful effects. [link to implications]</p>

		<p class="reading" style="font-style:italic;">Workers of every stripe—from corporate finance officers to sales people to machine operators to utility workers and nurses and Uber drivers—are now spending sizable portions of their workdays using tools that require digital skills.</p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">The U.S. economy is digitalizing at an extremely rapid pace.</p>
		<p>Between 2002 and 2016, the shares of U.S. jobs that require substantial digital knowledge rose rapidly, whether because of changes in the digital content of existing occupations or due to shifts in the distribution of occupations.<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/metro_test-file2.pdf#page=7" target="_blank" class="blue-link">Read more about the changing U.S. workforce – pointer icon » <span class="link-icon"></span> »</a></p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">The degree and pace of change of digitalization varies widely among occupations and across industries.</p>
		<p>Digitalization scores rose in 517 of 545 analyzed occupations from 2002 to 2016. The average digitalization score across all occupations rose from a low level of 29 in 2002 to a medium level of 46 in 2016, a 57 percent increase.</p>

	<div class="col-center reading">
		<p>Additionally, virtually all industry groups saw their mean digital scores increase from 2002 to 2016, though the degree and speed of digital adoption vary significantly. Leading the digitalization race is a group of broad service sectors, including professional, scientific and technical services (55); media (52); and finance and insurance (55). On the lower end, education, transportation and warehousing, basic goods manufacturing, and construction have scores mostly in the 30s.

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">Digitalization is associated with increased pay and job resiliency in the face of automation but also vastly uneven trends for job growth and wages, and presents gender- and race-based challenges.</p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">Metropolitan area data</p>

		<p>Digitalization is happening everywhere, but its progress varies unevenly across the map. Metropolitan areas’ current wage levels and recent wage growth appear to be highly correlated with mean digitalization scores. Additionally, metros are diverging in their digitalization ratings: the higher (or lower) a metro area’s 2002 share of high-level digital occupations, the greater (or lesser) the growth of its share of jobs in such occupations in the years 2002 to 2016.
