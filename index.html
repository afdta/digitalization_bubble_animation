		<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n recent decades, the diffusion of digital technology into nearly every business and workplace, also known as “digitalization,” has been remaking the U.S. economy and the world of work, increasing the potential of individuals, firms and society while also contributing to a series of troublesome impacts and inequalities, such as worker pay disparities across many demographics, and the divergence of metropolitan economic outcomes. </p>

		<p>This report presents a detailed analysis of changes in the digital content of 545 occupations covering 90 percent of the U.S. workforce in all industries since 2001. The analysis categorizes U.S. occupations into jobs that require high, medium or low digital skills. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/metro_test-file2.pdf#page=20" target="_blank" class="blue-link">For more on methodolgy, see page X of the report <span class="link-icon"></span> »</a> </p>

		<p>The full report concludes with implications of the key findings and suggests ways communities can work with firms and workers to spread the benefits of digitalization while mitigating its potentially harmful effects. [link to implications]</p>

		<p>Additionally, virtually all industry groups saw their mean digital scores increase from 2002 to 2016, though the degree and speed of digital adoption vary significantly. Leading the digitalization race is a group of broad service sectors, including professional, scientific and technical services (55); media (52); and finance and insurance (55). On the lower end, education, transportation and warehousing, basic goods manufacturing, and construction have scores mostly in the 30s.

			<div class="reading">
				<p>Digitalization is happening everywhere, but its progress varies unevenly across the map. Metropolitan areas’ current wage levels and recent wage growth appear to be highly correlated with mean digitalization scores. Additionally, metros are diverging in their digitalization ratings: the higher (or lower) a metro area’s 2002 share of high-level digital occupations, the greater (or lesser) the growth of its share of jobs in such occupations in the years 2002 to 2016.
