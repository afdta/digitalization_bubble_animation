		<p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n recent decades, wave after wave of digital innovation has ensured that "digitalization"—the diffusion of digital technology into nearly every business, workplace, and pocket—has been remaking the U.S. economy and the world of work. </p>
		<p>So rapid are the developments, in fact, that while the "digitalization of everything" has become a hallmark of tech's promise of individual and business empowerment so has it begun to prompt a nagging current of anxiety, including among workers who worry about their future in a world of brilliant machines</p>
		<p>And yet, for all of the evidence that big changes are underway, surprisingly little data exist to track the spread of digital adoption across industries and into local workplaces and labor markets. In the absence of such information, the digitalization trend, as prominent as it is, remains diffuse and hard to pin down.</p>
		<p><span style="color:#555555">[Condense into short description of definitions and sources and link to methodology for more].</span> Hence this report: Designed to help address the shortage of data on the topic, this analysis presents a detailed analysis of changes in the digital content of 545 occupations covering 90 percent of the U.S. workforce in all industries since 2001. We use data on employment and wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program in combination with detailed, occupation-specific skill data from BLS' Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database. We leverage O*NET’s "computer-knowledge" and "computer-importance" scores for each occupations to create a rating of the digital content of these 545 occupations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/metro_test-file2.pdf#page=20" target="_blank" class="blue-link">For more on methodolgy, see page X of the report <span class="link-icon"></span> »</a></p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">The U.S. economy is digitalizing at an extremely rapid pace</p>
		<p>Between 2002 to 2016 the shares of U.S. jobs and employment that require substantial digital knowledge rose rapidly, whether because of changes in the digital content of existing occupations (the largest effect, by far) or due to shifts in the distribution of occupations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/metro_test-file2.pdf#page=7" target="_blank" class="blue-link">View page 7 of the report <span class="link-icon"></span> »</a></p>

		<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:2em;line-height:1.5em;color:#0d73d6;">The degree and pace of change of digitalization varies widely among occupations and across industries.</p>
		<p>Digitalization scores rose in 517 of 545 analyzed occupations from 2002 to 2016. The average digitalization score across all occupations rose from 29 in 2002 to 46 in 2016, a 57 percent increase.</p>
